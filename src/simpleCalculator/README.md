# simple-calculator

You are required to implement a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. The calculator should:

1. Prompt the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
2. After selecting the operation, prompt the user to input two numbers.
3. Perform the chosen operation on the two numbers and display the result.

The program should handle the following operations:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

Make sure the program validates the user input and handles any potential errors, such as division by zero.
